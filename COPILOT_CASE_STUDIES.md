## ✅ Issue #4555 / PR #4659: [Bug] User tasks.json doesn't work anymore [Success]

**Reported behavior:** User-level tasks defined in `~/.config/Code/User/tasks.json` caused an infinite spinner when executed. The same task worked when placed in the project's `.vscode/tasks.json`. The Extension Host log showed `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'path')` in `CustomBuildTaskTerminal.getProject()`. Downgrading to v1.20.53 resolved the issue.

**Agent patch (as implemented/claimed):** Copilot correctly identified the root cause: both `resolveTask()` and `resolveInternalTask()` unconditionally cast `task.scope` to `WorkspaceFolder`, but VS Code's Task API defines `task.scope` as `WorkspaceFolder | TaskScope.Global | TaskScope.Workspace`. User-level tasks have `scope = TaskScope.Global` (numeric value 1), causing the cast to produce invalid state. The fix adds a type guard (`task.scope && typeof task.scope === 'object'`) and falls back to `TaskScope.Workspace` when scope is not a `WorkspaceFolder`. The fix is small (+14/−6, 2 files) and `CustomBuildTaskTerminal` already handles `undefined` workspaceFolder by falling back to the active project.

**Initial Assessment:**

- **Correctness:** 🟢 Correct. The fix precisely matches the stack trace and uses a type guard that correctly handles the `TaskScope` enum vs `WorkspaceFolder` object distinction. The `typeof null === 'object'` edge case is also handled.
- **Regression risk:** ⚠️ Low. The change is localized to task resolution and adds defensive type checking without altering the happy path for workspace-scoped tasks.
- **Test hygiene / verification:** ⚠️ Limited. No unit tests were added for the type guard logic, relying on manual testing.
- **Documentation & traceability:** 🟢 Good. PR description clearly explains the before/after, includes the stack trace, and links the correct issue.

**Original prompt:** CMake Prompt (standard agent prompt with issue context)

**Updates:** Senior engineer reviewed and gave positive feedback. Merged in 5 days.

## ✅ Issue #4651 / PR #4660: [Bug] additionalKits not shown when showSystemKits is false [Success]

**Reported behavior:** Kits from `cmake.additionalKits` (including devcontainer customizations) were hidden when `showSystemKits` was set to `false`, even though additional kits are explicitly user-specified and should always be visible.

**Agent patch (as implemented/claimed):** Copilot identified that the `availableKits` getter conflated user-specified additional kits with auto-discovered system kits. When `showSystemKits` was false, the `else` branch only returned `specialKits.concat(folderKits)`, omitting `additionalKits`. The fix simply adds `additionalKits` to the `else` branch. Minimal change: +2/−1 across 2 files.

**Initial Assessment:**

- **Correctness:** 🟢 Correct. The semantic distinction between user-specified (`additionalKits`) and auto-discovered (`userKits`) kits is clear, and the fix correctly preserves user-specified kits regardless of the `showSystemKits` toggle.
- **Regression risk:** ⚠️ Low. The change is a one-line addition to an existing conditional branch.
- **Test hygiene / verification:** ⚠️ Limited. No unit tests added. Manual verification needed to confirm kits appear in the picker.
- **Documentation & traceability:** ⚠️ Mixed. PR hygiene (linkage, boilerplate) was noted as a weak point even though the technical approach was sound. Defensive, low-risk fixes are a strength area for Copilot.

**Original prompt:** CMake Prompt

**Updates:** Originally assessed as "Potential" — promoted to merged after manual testing confirmed behavior. PR hygiene (linkage, boilerplate) remains a weak point.

## 🟡 Issue #4639 / PR #4661: [Bug] CJK characters in PATH cause Visual C++ configuration failure [Potential Success]

**Reported behavior:** When the Windows PATH contains CJK characters and Windows UTF-8 beta mode is enabled, encoding corruption introduces null bytes (`\u0000`) into environment variable values. Node.js `child_process.spawn` throws on null characters, causing Visual C++ configuration to fail with `"cl undefined" returned code -1`.

**Agent patch (as implemented/claimed):** Copilot added a null character sanitizer in `EnvironmentPrivate.set()` that strips `\0` from string values before they're used. The fix includes a type check since `value` can be `null` when `preserveNull` is `true`. A unit test was also added. Small change: +35/−0 across 2 files. CodeQL security check passed.

**Initial Assessment:**

- **Correctness:** 🟢 Mostly correct. The defensive sanitization addresses the immediate crash. However, stripping null bytes is a lossy workaround for the underlying encoding corruption — the path will still be incorrect, just non-crashing.
- **Regression risk:** ⚠️ Low. Null bytes in environment variable values are never valid on any platform, so stripping them is unconditionally safe.
- **Test hygiene / verification:** 🟢 Good. Includes a unit test for the null character sanitization behavior.
- **Documentation & traceability:** 🟢 Good. PR clearly explains the encoding corruption chain and provides the real-world example from the issue.

**Original prompt:** CMake Prompt

**Updates:** Still open as draft. Needs manual testing on Windows with CJK paths to confirm the fix prevents the crash without breaking other functionality.

## 🟡 Issue #4623 / PR #4678: [Bug] Visual Studio kit scanning with non-ASCII installation paths [Potential Failure]

**Reported behavior:** Visual Studio kit scanning fails when the VS installation path contains non-ASCII characters, preventing proper compiler detection.

**Agent patch (as implemented/claimed):** Copilot updated the changelog and linked the bug correctly. The test aligned with what the bug was reporting. However, the person who filed the issue also had a PR of their own, and Copilot approached the fix very differently from the contributor's approach.

**Initial Assessment:**

- **Correctness:** ⚠️ Questionable. While Copilot's approach may work, the contributor's PR was already fairly complete and utilized an existing pattern in the codebase. Senior engineer feedback indicated that Copilot should have followed the contributor's established pattern.
- **Regression risk:** ⚠️ Medium. Diverging from the established codebase pattern introduces unnecessary risk compared to the contributor's approach.
- **Test hygiene / verification:** ⚠️ Limited. No indication of comprehensive testing that validates both approaches.
- **Documentation & traceability:** 🟢 Good. Changelog and issue linkage were correct.

**Original prompt:** CMake Prompt

**Updates:** **Critical finding:** Copilot does not reference or learn from existing PRs or established codebase patterns. When a contributor has already proposed a fix using existing patterns, Copilot should ideally recognize and align with that approach rather than diverging. This suggests Copilot lacks awareness of concurrent community contributions and existing code conventions.

## ❌ Issue #4589 / PR #4663: [Bug] GoogleTest failure hyperlinking in Test Results [Failure]

**Reported behavior:** The Test Results panel did not hyperlink file paths from GoogleTest failure output, making it difficult to navigate directly to failing test locations.

**Agent patch (as implemented/claimed):** Copilot proposed adding a default regex pattern to `cmake.ctest.failurePatterns` for GoogleTest output. The approach was directionally reasonable — using a regex to parse GoogleTest's failure output format and extract file paths.

**Initial Assessment:**

- **Correctness:** 🔴 Incorrect in practice. The regex pattern failed CI due to Windows path/URI normalization differences. GoogleTest outputs Windows paths (`C:\path\file.cpp`) but VS Code expects URIs, and the conversion was not handled correctly.
- **Regression risk:** ⚠️ Medium. The pattern could produce broken hyperlinks on some platforms while working on others.
- **Test hygiene / verification:** 🔴 Insufficient. The CI failure on Windows path handling indicates the solution was not validated cross-platform before submission.
- **Documentation & traceability:** ⚠️ Mixed. PR description was adequate but lacked cross-platform considerations.

**Original prompt:** CMake Prompt

**Updates:** Closed after CI failures could not be resolved. Indicates insufficient end-to-end validation — Copilot did not adequately consider Windows path normalization edge cases.

---

## ❌ Issue #4267 / PR #4665: [Bug] Disabled gtest cases executed in CTest runs [Failure]

**Reported behavior:** GTest test cases prefixed with `DISABLED_` were being executed during CTest runs instead of being skipped, causing unexpected failures.

**Agent patch (as implemented/claimed):** Copilot analyzed the issue and suggested a solution in the PR description, but **did not implement any code during the session**. The PR has 0 file changes (+0/−0).

**Initial Assessment:**

- **Correctness:** ❌ Not applicable — no code was produced.
- **Regression risk:** N/A — no code to evaluate.
- **Test hygiene / verification:** ❌ None.
- **Documentation & traceability:** ⚠️ The PR description contained analysis but no implementation.

**Original prompt:** CMake Prompt (GPT-5.2-Codex model)

**Updates:** Closed without merge. This appears to be a case where the Codex model could analyze the problem but failed to follow through with implementation. Unlike other failures where code was produced but incorrect, here no code was produced at all.

---

## ❌ Issue #4668 / PR #4669: [Bug] Preset watcher infinite reload loop [Failure]

**Reported behavior:** The CMake Presets file watcher was triggering infinite reload loops, causing the extension to continuously re-read and re-process preset files, resulting in high CPU usage and an unusable IDE experience. This issue had significant community activity.

**Agent patch (as implemented/claimed):** Copilot initially produced a band-aid fix using chokidar debouncing. Across 4 iteration sessions, the fix was refined based on feedback from both the Copilot chat and senior engineers. However, each iteration introduced more problems rather than resolving the core issue. By the fourth iteration, tests were red.

**Initial Assessment:**

- **Correctness:** 🔴 Incorrect. The band-aid approach (debouncing) did not address the root cause — that chokidar's `followSymlinks` behavior could trigger recursive watching. Each iteration compounded the errors.
- **Regression risk:** 🔴 High. The iterative changes introduced test regressions by the fourth attempt.
- **Test hygiene / verification:** ⚠️ Tests were ultimately red, indicating regressions.
- **Documentation & traceability:** ⚠️ Multiple iterations made the PR history complex and hard to follow.

**Original prompt:** CMake Prompt (4 separate sessions)

**Updates:**
- **Session 1:** Band-aid debouncing fix
- **Sessions 2-3:** Attempted to incorporate senior engineer feedback, but introduced more mistakes
- **Session 4:** Tests red, PR abandoned
- hanniavalera authored PR #4670 with a fundamentally different approach: migrating from Chokidar to VS Code's `FileSystemWatcher` API (+421/−14 lines)

**Key takeaway:** Copilot struggles with iterative refinement — additional context and feedback led to regression rather than improvement. The "band-aid fix" pattern suggests Copilot prioritizes quick solutions over root cause analysis. Multi-iteration workflows may compound errors.

## 🟡 Issue #4621 / PR #4674: [Bug] Test explorer tree state reset on test execution [Potential]

**Reported behavior:** When running tests with `cmake.ctest.testSuiteDelimiter` enabled, the Test Explorer tree collapsed back to its default state after each test run, losing the user's expand/collapse preferences.

**Agent patch (as implemented/claimed):** Copilot identified that VS Code tracks UI state by TestItem object identity, not by ID. The fix replaces the unconditional `testExplorerRoot.children.replace([])` with selective updates that reuse existing TestItem objects. Properties are updated on reuse, and stale items are tracked and removed. The approach includes a documented limitation: nested tests removed from suites remain until parent suite removal.

**Initial Assessment:**

- **Correctness:** ⚠️ Partially correct. The approach is sound — preserving TestItem object identity is the correct strategy for maintaining UI state. However, all tests are red, indicating implementation issues.
- **Regression risk:** ⚠️ Medium. The change touches core Test Explorer refresh logic, and existing tests failing suggest potential regressions.
- **Test hygiene / verification:** 🔴 Tests are red. The implementation needs debugging before merge.
- **Documentation & traceability:** 🟢 Good. PR clearly documents the approach, the limitation, and the technical rationale.

**Original prompt:** CMake Prompt

**Updates:** Copilot conducted self-review during the session and iterated, which is a positive signal. Self-review and iteration within a single session can produce better outcomes. However, the red tests indicate more work is needed.

## ✅ Issue #4551 / PR #4672: [Bug] CMake debugger Copy Value copies variable name instead of value [Success]

**Reported behavior:** When debugging CMake scripts, right-clicking a variable in the Watch window and selecting "Copy Value" copied the variable name (e.g., "VAR1") instead of the actual value (e.g., "99999").

**Agent patch (as implemented/claimed):** Copilot identified that CMake 3.27+ debugger incorrectly sets `evaluateName` to the variable name in DAP protocol responses. VS Code's "Copy Value" feature uses `evaluateName` when present, causing the wrong value to be copied. The fix intercepts DAP `variables` responses in `DebugTrackerFactory` via `onWillReceiveMessage` and strips the `evaluateName` property, forcing VS Code to fall back to the `value` property. Unit tests were included validating message interception behavior. 3 files changed, +112/−0.

**Initial Assessment:**

- **Correctness:** 🟢 Correct. The fix is surgical — it only modifies the specific DAP message type causing the issue, and other debug protocol messages pass through unmodified.
- **Regression risk:** ⚠️ Low. The change only affects DAP `variables` response messages and doesn't alter debugging behavior.
- **Test hygiene / verification:** 🟢 Good. Unit tests validate the message interception and `evaluateName` stripping behavior.
- **Documentation & traceability:** 🟢 Good. PR clearly explains the DAP protocol interaction and the root cause.

**Original prompt:** CMake Prompt (simplified, focused prompt for unit test generation)

**Updates:** Simplified, focused prompts yielded better results. Copilot performed better when given clear, scoped tasks (e.g., "generate unit test") rather than open-ended problem-solving. Prompt engineering significantly impacts output quality.

---

## 🟡 Issue #4509 / PR #4671: [Bug] CMake: Set Build Target shows only preset targets [Potential Failure]

**Reported behavior:** When using CMake Presets with build presets that define a `targets` field, `CMake: Set Build Target` only showed the preset-defined targets instead of all available CMake targets from the code model. Users with 800+ targets could only see the preset subset.

**Agent patch (as implemented/claimed):** Copilot removed the early return in `showTargetSelector()` that filtered targets to only preset-defined ones, and prepended a `[Targets In Preset]` option to the full target list. The change is +6/−7 across 2 files with a changelog entry.

**Initial Assessment:**

- **Correctness:** ⚠️ Partially correct. The approach allows access to all targets while preserving the preset target option, but the implementation may not handle all edge cases. Copilot's self-review was not very confident.
- **Regression risk:** ⚠️ Medium. Changing target selector behavior could affect users who rely on the current preset-only filtering.
- **Test hygiene / verification:** 🔴 No unit tests provided. Manual testing required.
- **Documentation & traceability:** 🟢 Good. Technical details section clearly shows before/after code.

**Original prompt:** CMake Prompt

**Updates:** Copilot can diagnose issues but falls short on implementation completeness. Lack of unit tests indicates gaps in understanding testing requirements for this codebase. Self-review confidence levels may be a useful signal for when human intervention is needed earlier.

---

## ❌ Issue #4613 / PR #4673: [Bug] Deprecated command highlighting for variable names [Failure — Closed]

**Reported behavior:** The CMake syntax highlighter was flagging `SOURCE_FILES` and other deprecated CMake 1.x command names as invalid even when used as variable names in contexts like `set(SOURCE_FILES ...)` and `${SOURCE_FILES}`.

**Agent patch (as implemented/claimed):** Copilot attempted to fix the TextMate grammar by anchoring the deprecated command pattern to line start (`^\s*\b`) instead of matching anywhere (`\b`), consistent with how regular commands are matched. Small change: +3/−2, 2 files. Also fixed a typo ("Derecated" → "Deprecated").

**Initial Assessment:**

- **Correctness:** ⚠️ Partially correct. The regex anchoring is a valid approach for the specific symptom, but it was too narrow — it didn't address the broader grammar registration issues that caused the 1.22.26 colorization regression.
- **Regression risk:** ⚠️ Low. TextMate grammar change only — no code impact.
- **Test hygiene / verification:** ⚠️ Limited. No automated grammar tests.
- **Documentation & traceability:** 🟢 Good. Clearly explains the pattern change with diff notation.

**Original prompt:** CMake Prompt

**Updates:** Closed without merge. The underlying issue was addressed more comprehensively as part of the broader colorization rewrite in PR #4697, which hanniavalera authored directly. Copilot's fix only addressed one symptom while the root cause was broader.

---

## ✅ Issue #4484 / PR #4681: [Bug] cmake.compileFile fails with presets [Success]

**Reported behavior:** `cmake.compileFile` (single-file compilation) failed with "Unable to find compilation information for this file" when using CMake Presets, even after a successful configure. The root cause was that `compile_commands.json` was not being generated.

**Agent patch (as implemented/claimed):** Copilot correctly identified that presets weren't exporting `CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS` by default (unlike kits). The fix appends `-DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS` to preset configure arguments when neither the preset cache variables nor existing args define it, mirroring kit behavior. The change properly checks both `presetCacheVariables` and `expandedArgs` before adding the flag. +15/−1 across 2 files with changelog entry.

**Initial Assessment:**

- **Correctness:** 🟢 Correct. The fix mirrors the exact pattern used for kits and properly checks for existing definitions to avoid overriding user-specified values.
- **Regression risk:** ⚠️ Low. The change only adds the flag when it's not already present, preserving user intent.
- **Test hygiene / verification:** ⚠️ Limited. No unit tests created, but changelog entry was properly added.
- **Documentation & traceability:** 🟢 Good. Code snippet in PR description clearly shows the logic.

**Original prompt:** CMake Prompt

**Updates:** None needed. Clean first-attempt fix that followed existing patterns.

## ❌ Issue #4676 / PR #4677: [Bug] Syntax highlighting broken since 1.22.26 [Failure — Closed]

**Reported behavior:** Syntax highlighting for CMake files was completely broken after updating to v1.22.26. All CMakeLists.txt files appeared as plain text without colorization. Downgrading to v1.21.36 immediately restored highlighting.

**Agent patch (as implemented/claimed):** Copilot attempted to restore the grammar registration by adding the correctly cased `CMakeLists.txt` alongside the legacy lowercase variant in the grammar contribution's `filenames` array. Small change: +2/−1, 2 files.

**Initial Assessment:**

- **Correctness:** ⚠️ Partially correct. The fix addressed one symptom (filename casing) but didn't address the full colorization regression from 1.22.26, which involved broader grammar migration issues.
- **Regression risk:** ⚠️ Low. Adding a filename variant is additive and safe.
- **Test hygiene / verification:** ⚠️ Limited. No grammar tests.
- **Documentation & traceability:** 🟢 Good. Clearly explains the pattern change.

**Original prompt:** CMake Prompt

**Updates:** Changes were requested by reviewer — the fix was too narrow. hanniavalera authored PR #4697 with a comprehensive revert+reapply approach that addressed the broader grammar migration issue. Copilot's fix only addressed one symptom of a larger problem.

---

## 🟡 Issue #4563 / PR #4679: [Bug] Handle early CMake task failures to avoid stalled build tasks [Potential Success]

**Reported behavior:** When CMake tasks fail early (before the build process starts), the task would stall indefinitely instead of reporting the failure and completing.

**Agent patch (as implemented/claimed):** Copilot identified the common failure path and implemented a fix that addresses early task failure handling. Small change: +3/−0, 1 file. Copilot self-assessed the fix positively, noting it would address one common failure path.

**Initial Assessment:**

- **Correctness:** 🟢 Likely correct for the specific failure path addressed. The fix is defensive and narrowly scoped.
- **Regression risk:** ⚠️ Low. The change adds error handling without altering the normal execution path.
- **Test hygiene / verification:** ⚠️ Limited. No changelog entry or unit test was created.
- **Documentation & traceability:** ⚠️ Weak. Missing changelog entry and unit tests.

**Original prompt:** CMake Prompt

**Updates:** Partial solutions may be acceptable for incremental progress, but Copilot does not proactively identify missing deliverables (changelog, tests). Human checklist enforcement is still required.

---

## 🟡 Issue #4560 / PR #4680: [Bug] ${buildKitTargetArch} is 'unknown' for Visual Studio Kits [Potential]

**Reported behavior:** When using `${buildKitTargetArch}` as variable substitution in build directory paths for Visual Studio kits, the created folder was always `build/unknown` regardless of the target architecture (x64, x86, ARM, ARM64).

**Agent patch (as implemented/claimed):** Copilot attempted to normalize Visual Studio kit architectures (x86/x64/arm/arm64/amd64/win32) to canonical target triples so `${buildKitTargetArch}` expands correctly. The approach maps VS kit arch names directly rather than relying on the triple parsing that fails for VS kits. Draft with +43/−5 across 4 files.

**Initial Assessment:**

- **Correctness:** ⚠️ Likely correct for common cases, but needs Windows-specific testing with various VS kit configurations to validate.
- **Regression risk:** ⚠️ Medium. Architecture mapping is critical for build directory resolution and could affect existing workflows if not handled correctly.
- **Test hygiene / verification:** ⚠️ Limited. Has 1 review comment. Needs manual testing on Windows.
- **Documentation & traceability:** 🟢 Good. PR includes before/after examples.

**Original prompt:** CMake Prompt

**Updates:** Still in draft. Needs manual testing on Windows with VS 2019 and VS 2022 across various target architectures.

## 🟡 Issue #4313 / PR #4682: [Bug] Missing environment variables in ctest command with test presets [Potential — Stalled]

**Reported behavior:** Test presets with environment variables defined were not passing those variables through to the `ctest` command invocation. Running `ctest --preset ${my-preset}` from terminal correctly applied the environment, but the Test Explorer did not.

**Agent patch (as implemented/claimed):** Copilot opened a [WIP] draft with a checklist of tasks but only committed 1 commit. The PR has incomplete implementation.

**Initial Assessment:**

- **Correctness:** ❓ Cannot assess — implementation is incomplete.
- **Regression risk:** N/A — incomplete.
- **Test hygiene / verification:** ❌ None.
- **Documentation & traceability:** ⚠️ Has a task checklist but no implementation.

**Original prompt:** CMake Prompt

**Updates:** Stalled. Needs Copilot to finish the implementation. The issue is about test preset environment passthrough, which requires understanding the CTest invocation pipeline.

---

## ❌ Issue #4683 / PR #4684: [Bug] "No view is registered with id: cmake.bookmarks" error [Failure — Closed]

**Reported behavior:** After the latest update, users hitting `No view is registered with id: cmake.bookmarks` error notification, particularly in workspaces without `CMakeLists.txt`. The bookmarks view (added in PR #4539) was missing its activation event.

**Agent patch (as implemented/claimed):** Copilot proposed adding `onView:cmake.bookmarks` to `activationEvents` in `package.json`, along with a changelog entry. Small fix: +4/−1, 2 files.

**Initial Assessment:**

- **Correctness:** ⚠️ Partially correct. The activation event approach would fix the immediate error, but the bookmarks feature was being reworked, and the broader activation logic needed different handling.
- **Regression risk:** ⚠️ Low. Adding an activation event is safe.
- **Test hygiene / verification:** ⚠️ Limited. No tests added.
- **Documentation & traceability:** 🟢 Good. PR includes repro steps and screenshot.

**Original prompt:** CMake Prompt

**Updates:** Closed without merge. The bookmarks feature needed broader reworking rather than a point fix to the activation event.

---

## 🟡 Issue #4667 / PR #4686: [Feature] Auto-detect .cmake.in files as cmake files [Potential — Stalled]

**Reported behavior:** Feature request: `.cmake.in` template files (commonly used in CMake projects for `config.cmake.in`) should be automatically detected and given CMake syntax highlighting without manual language selection.

**Agent patch (as implemented/claimed):** Copilot opened a [WIP] draft with a placeholder description ("Thanks for assigning this issue to me. I'm starting to work on it…") and committed only 1 commit. Implementation is incomplete.

**Initial Assessment:**

- **Correctness:** ❓ Cannot assess — implementation is incomplete.
- **Regression risk:** N/A — incomplete.
- **Test hygiene / verification:** ❌ None.
- **Documentation & traceability:** ⚠️ Placeholder PR description.

**Original prompt:** CMake Prompt

**Updates:** Stalled. The feature is straightforward (register file extension in `package.json`), but Copilot never completed the implementation.

---

## 🟡 Issue #4000 / PR #4696: [Bug] Ctrl+S not working in CMake Cache Editor UI [Potential Success]

**Reported behavior:** The keyboard shortcut Ctrl+S (or File > Save) had no effect in the CMake Cache Editor UI. Only the in-webview "Save" button worked, because the editor used a regular `WebviewPanel` which doesn't integrate with VS Code's native save system.

**Agent patch (as implemented/claimed):** Copilot correctly identified the architectural mismatch and replaced the `WebviewPanel` with a `CustomTextEditorProvider`, which ties into VS Code's document save lifecycle. This is a significant change: new `cmakeCacheEditorProvider.ts` file, updated `extension.ts` registration, simplified `editCacheUI()`, added `customEditors` contribution to `package.json`, and localization strings. Total: +552/−30, 6 files. The approach uses the correct VS Code API pattern and includes manual test steps in the PR description.

**Initial Assessment:**

- **Correctness:** 🟢 Correct approach. `CustomTextEditorProvider` is the right VS Code API for this use case. It enables Ctrl+S, dirty state indicator, and auto-save integration.
- **Regression risk:** ⚠️ Medium-High. This is a large surface-area change replacing the entire cache editor architecture. Needs thorough manual testing for save/dirty-state/auto-save/undo behaviors.
- **Test hygiene / verification:** 🔴 No unit tests for the new provider. Relies entirely on manual testing.
- **Documentation & traceability:** 🟢 Good. Includes detailed files changed list, manual test steps, and changelog entry.

**Original prompt:** CMake Prompt

**Updates:** Blocked on reviews. The scope of the change warrants careful manual testing before merge. Despite the large change, the approach is architecturally sound.

---

## ✅ Issue #4219 / PR #4708: [Bug] Target selection fails when build type doesn't match codemodel configuration [Success]

**Reported behavior:** With single-config generators (e.g., Ninja) and presets that don't explicitly set `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`, the extension's target resolution failed silently. The `Set Build Target` command showed no targets, and build operations could fail.

**Agent patch (as implemented/claimed):** Copilot identified a key mismatch: `currentBuildType` defaults to "Debug" but the codemodel stores targets under "" (empty string) when no build type is set. The fix adds a fallback in the target map lookup: when exact lookup fails and `_target_map.size === 1`, use the single available entry. Multi-config generators are unaffected. Applied to both `cmakeFileApiDriver.ts` and `cmakeServerDriver.ts`. 4 files, +113/−2, including unit tests and changelog.

**Initial Assessment:**

- **Correctness:** 🟢 Correct. Clean root cause analysis with a targeted fix that doesn't affect multi-config generators. The single-entry fallback is safe because single-config generators by definition only have one configuration.
- **Regression risk:** ⚠️ Low. The fallback only triggers when the existing exact lookup fails, preserving current behavior for all working configurations.
- **Test hygiene / verification:** 🟢 Good. Unit tests included covering both the fallback case and multi-config non-interference.
- **Documentation & traceability:** 🟢 Good. Changelog and clear PR description.

**Original prompt:** CMake Prompt (Opus 4.6 model)

**Updates:** This is one of the strongest fixes in the batch. Clean root cause analysis, targeted fix, unit tests included, and it addresses a frequently reported issue.

---

## 🟡 Issue #4051 / PR #4707: [Bug] Invalid field 'host=x86' in CMake configuration for VS 2017 [Potential]

**Reported behavior:** VS 2017 (majorVersion 15) with its bundled CMake 3.12 doesn't support the `host=x86` toolset field, causing configuration failures.

**Agent patch (as implemented/claimed):** Copilot identified the root cause: the extension was only excluding `host=` for versions < 15 (VS 2013 and earlier), but VS 2017's bundled CMake 3.12 also doesn't support it. The planned fix would change the threshold from `majorVersion < 15` to `majorVersion < 16`. However, the PR is [WIP] with 0 file changes committed (+0/−0).

**Initial Assessment:**

- **Correctness:** 🟢 Correct diagnosis. The threshold change is the right fix.
- **Regression risk:** ⚠️ Low. The fix is a single numeric threshold change.
- **Test hygiene / verification:** ❌ No code committed means no testing possible.
- **Documentation & traceability:** ⚠️ PR description documents the diagnosis well, but no implementation exists.

**Original prompt:** CMake Prompt (Opus 4.6 model)

**Updates:** Diagnosis is correct and fix is trivial, but implementation is incomplete. Needs Copilot to finish committing the one-line code change.

---

## ✅ Issue #4358 / PR #4706: [Bug] cmake.installPrefix not passed to CMake when using presets [Success]

**Reported behavior:** The `cmake.installPrefix` setting was silently ignored when using presets, meaning `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` was never set during configure, even though users expected it to work regardless of whether they used kits or presets.

**Agent patch (as implemented/claimed):** Copilot identified two issues: (1) `_refreshExpansions()` only expanded `installPrefix` in the non-preset branch, and (2) `generateConfigArgsFromPreset()` never emitted `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`. The fix moves `installPrefix` expansion out of the non-preset guard and adds it to preset config arg generation with proper precedence: preset `cacheVars` > `configureArgs` > setting. 3 files, +15/−6. Follows the exact same pattern as `CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS` handling.

**Initial Assessment:**

- **Correctness:** 🟢 Correct. Mirrors an established pattern for another cache variable in the same function, ensuring consistent behavior.
- **Regression risk:** ⚠️ Low. The precedence chain (preset > args > setting) respects user intent at every level.
- **Test hygiene / verification:** ⚠️ Limited. No unit tests, but the pattern is well-established in the codebase.
- **Documentation & traceability:** 🟢 Good. Changelog included. PR description shows the precedence logic clearly.

**Original prompt:** CMake Prompt (Opus 4.6 model)

**Updates:** High maintainer confidence. The fix mirrors an established pattern, minimal risk.

---

## ❌ Issue #4529 / PR #4705: [Bug] Workspace tasks cannot be run [Closed — Superseded]

**Reported behavior:** CMake tasks defined in `.code-workspace` files caused TypeError because VS Code sets `task.scope` to `TaskScope.Workspace` (a number), not a `WorkspaceFolder` object.

**Agent patch (as implemented/claimed):** Copilot correctly diagnosed the same root cause as PR #4659 (the `task.scope` type-checking issue) and proposed extracting a shared `getWorkspaceFolderFromTask()` helper. Small change: +18/−6, 2 files. The root cause analysis matches the stack trace perfectly.

**Initial Assessment:**

- **Correctness:** 🟢 Correct diagnosis and implementation.
- **Regression risk:** ⚠️ Low.
- **Test hygiene / verification:** ⚠️ Limited. No unit tests.
- **Documentation & traceability:** 🟢 Good.

**Original prompt:** CMake Prompt (Opus 4.6 model)

**Updates:** Closed because the underlying fix was already merged via PR #4659 which addressed the same `task.scope` type-checking issue from a different angle. This PR was redundant — same root cause, different entry point. **Key takeaway:** Copilot does not check for already-merged fixes before starting work on a related issue.

---

## ❌ Issue #4512 / PR #4704: [Bug] Active folder not used for build task in multi-root workspace [Closed — Stalled]

**Reported behavior:** CMake tasks always built in the workspace root instead of the active folder in multi-root workspace configurations.

**Agent patch (as implemented/claimed):** The PR is marked [WIP] with 0 file changes (+0/−0). The PR description is a placeholder ("Thanks for assigning this issue to me. I'm starting to work on it…"). Copilot never produced any code.

**Initial Assessment:**

- **Correctness:** ❌ Not applicable — no code produced.
- **Regression risk:** N/A.
- **Test hygiene / verification:** ❌ None.
- **Documentation & traceability:** ❌ Placeholder only.

**Original prompt:** CMake Prompt (Sonnet 4.5 model)

**Updates:** Closed because Copilot got stuck during investigation and never produced a fix. The multi-root workspace active folder resolution requires understanding VS Code's `TaskScope` lifecycle which Copilot couldn't navigate within the session constraints.

## 🟡 Issue #3575 / PR #4702: [Bug] Long compilation command truncation in Compile Active File [Potential Success]

**Reported behavior:** `CMake: Compile Active File` failed on complex projects because `terminal.sendText()` silently truncates commands at ~4096 characters (terminal emulator buffer limit). Projects with many `-I` include flags would hit this limit.

**Agent patch (as implemented/claimed):** Copilot identified the 4096-char terminal buffer limit and implemented a fix that writes long commands (>4000 chars) to a temporary script file (`.sh` on Unix, `.cmd` on Windows) and executes that instead. Copilot noted this reuses an established pattern from `visualStudio.ts` and `kit.ts` in the same codebase. Very small change: +37/−1, 2 files. Changelog included.

**Initial Assessment:**

- **Correctness:** 🟢 Correct. The temp-file approach is already proven elsewhere in the repo, and the 4000-char threshold provides safety margin below the 4096-char limit.
- **Regression risk:** ⚠️ Low. The temp-file approach is only used for long commands; short commands continue to use `sendText()` directly.
- **Test hygiene / verification:** ⚠️ Limited. No unit tests, but the fix is platform-aware (`.sh` vs `.cmd`) and follows existing conventions.
- **Documentation & traceability:** 🟢 Good. Changelog included. PR references the existing codebase pattern.

**Original prompt:** CMake Prompt (Opus 4.6 model)

**Updates:** Minimal, low-risk change that follows existing codebase patterns. Needs manual testing to verify the script file is cleaned up properly.

## 🟡 Issue #4574 / PR #4701: [Feature] Register cmake.testProgram et al. as VS Code commands [Potential Success]

**Reported behavior:** `${cmake.testProgram}`, `${cmake.testWorkingDirectory}`, and `${cmake.testArgs}` only worked via internal Test Explorer debugging. When used in `launch.json` for the Run and Debug panel, they failed because they were never registered as VS Code commands.

**Agent patch (as implemented/claimed):** Copilot registered three new VS Code commands and added a `pickTestName()` quick-pick fallback when invoked without test context. The fix also updates docs and maintains backward compatibility. 5 files, +70/−13. Changelog included.

**Initial Assessment:**

- **Correctness:** 🟢 Mostly correct. The approach mirrors how other command-based variable substitutions work in VS Code extensions.
- **Regression risk:** ⚠️ Low. New commands are additive; existing Test Explorer behavior is unchanged.
- **Test hygiene / verification:** ⚠️ Limited. No unit tests. Needs manual testing to confirm quick-pick UX and backward compat.
- **Documentation & traceability:** 🟢 Good. Changelog included with docs updates.

**Original prompt:** CMake Prompt (Opus 4.6 model)

**Updates:** Well-scoped, backward-compatible fix. Needs manual testing to confirm the quick-pick UX works correctly when invoked from Run and Debug panel.

## ✅ Issue #4569 / PR #4712: [Bug] Extension not switching to preset mode after Quick Start [Success]

**Reported behavior:** After Quick Start generates `CMakePresets.json`, the extension did not automatically switch to preset mode, requiring users to manually trigger the mode switch.

**Agent patch (as implemented/claimed):** Copilot added one `onUseCMakePresetsChanged` event subscription in `ProjectController.setupProjectSubscriptions()` following the identical pattern already used for other preset-changed events. One-line fix, clean and minimal. 2 files, +6/−1.

**Initial Assessment:**

- **Correctness:** 🟢 Correct. Follows the exact established pattern for preset state synchronization.
- **Regression risk:** ⚠️ Low. Adding an event subscription using an existing pattern has minimal risk.
- **Test hygiene / verification:** ⚠️ Limited. No unit tests, but the pattern is well-established.
- **Documentation & traceability:** 🟢 Good.

**Original prompt:** CMake Prompt

**Updates:** Clean, minimal fix. One of the best examples of Copilot following existing patterns.

## ✅ Issue #3578 / PR #4713: [Bug] $penv{} in preset includes ignores cmake.environment settings [Success]

**Reported behavior:** `$penv{}` in CMakePresets v7+ `include` paths only resolved variables from `process.env`. Variables defined in `cmake.environment` and `cmake.configureEnvironment` settings were silently ignored, causing preset includes to fail for users who relied on VS Code settings for environment configuration.

**Agent patch (as implemented/claimed):** Copilot added a `settingsEnvironment` setter to `PresetsParser` and merged settings environment variables into `penvOverride` for `expandString()`. This ensures that `$penv{}` in include paths resolves both process environment and VS Code settings. Well-scoped fix with an integration test. 4 files, +110/−2.

**Initial Assessment:**

- **Correctness:** 🟢 Correct. The `penvOverride` pattern was already established for process environment; extending it to include settings environment is a clean extension.
- **Regression risk:** ⚠️ Low. Settings environment is merged after process environment, preserving existing behavior while adding new capability.
- **Test hygiene / verification:** 🟢 Good. Includes integration test.
- **Documentation & traceability:** 🟢 Good.

**Original prompt:** CMake Prompt

**Updates:** Well-executed fix with proper testing.

## ✅ Issue #4453 / PR #4719: [Bug] CPack commands not appearing in command palette without presets [Success]

**Reported behavior:** The CPack status bar button worked, but the corresponding CPack commands (`cmake.cpack`, `cmake.cpackAll`) did not appear in the command palette when not using CMake Presets. This inconsistency confused users.

**Agent patch (as implemented/claimed):** Copilot identified that CPack execution commands were gated on `useCMakePresets` in their `when` clauses, while the status bar button had no such gate. The fix removes the `useCMakePresets` condition from CPack execution commands and fixes `getCPackCommandEnvironment()` to properly merge kit/config/variant environment in non-preset mode (it was returning `{}`, now matches the `getCTestCommandEnvironment()` pattern). 3 files, +12/−7.

**Initial Assessment:**

- **Correctness:** 🟢 Correct. The asymmetry between CPack and CTest command visibility was clearly a bug, and the environment fix ensures CPack works correctly in non-preset mode.
- **Regression risk:** ⚠️ Low. Preset-selection commands remain properly gated on `useCMakePresets`.
- **Test hygiene / verification:** ⚠️ Limited. Manual verification needed.
- **Documentation & traceability:** 🟢 Good. PR description clearly explains the asymmetry.

**Original prompt:** CMake Prompt

**Updates:** None needed. Clean fix that mirrors the CTest pattern.

## ✅ Issue #4520 / PR #4724: [Bug] Garbled characters (Mojibake) in Output panel for UTF-8 build output [Success]

**Reported behavior:** On non-UTF-8 Windows systems (e.g., Chinese code page 936), MSVC build output compiled with `/utf-8` flag showed garbled characters in the Output panel. The extension was decoding all build output using the system code page (GBK) instead of detecting UTF-8 output.

**Agent patch (as implemented/claimed):** Copilot added UTF-8 validation before falling back to system code page when `cmake.outputLogEncoding` is `auto`. The fix extracts `isValidUtf8()` to `src/encodingUtils.ts` (to avoid vscode dependency), adds a `useAutoEncoding` flag to `ExecutionOptions`, and validates each output chunk as UTF-8 first. Includes 20 unit tests covering ASCII, CJK UTF-8, GBK rejection, overlong sequences, surrogates, boundary splits, and invalid bytes. 5 files, +206/−5.

**Initial Assessment:**

- **Correctness:** 🟢 Correct. UTF-8-first detection is safe because GBK multi-byte sequences rarely form valid UTF-8, and the boundary handling correctly treats incomplete multi-byte sequences as valid (since Node.js `data` events can split mid-character).
- **Regression risk:** ⚠️ Low. Only affects the build output path when `outputLogEncoding` is `auto`. Configure and CTest already default to UTF-8.
- **Test hygiene / verification:** 🟢 Excellent. 20 unit tests covering edge cases including encoding boundaries, invalid sequences, and real-world CJK scenarios.
- **Documentation & traceability:** 🟢 Good. Detailed explanation with before/after examples.

**Original prompt:** CMake Prompt

**Updates:** One of the strongest fixes in terms of test coverage. The unit test suite is comprehensive and covers real-world encoding scenarios.

## ✅ Issue #4727 / PR #4728: [Bug] CMakePresets.json discovery fails after CMakeLists.txt selection in subdirectory [Success]

**Reported behavior:** When `cmake.sourceDirectory` is not explicitly set and the user selects a `CMakeLists.txt` from a subdirectory via the missing-CMakeLists dialog, `CMakePresets.json` continued to be looked up at the workspace root instead of next to the selected `CMakeLists.txt`.

**Agent patch (as implemented/claimed):** Copilot identified that `PresetsParser._sourceDir` was never updated after initial construction when `setSourceDir()` changed the project's source directory. The fix adds `PresetsController.updateSourceDir()` which propagates source directory changes to the `PresetsParser` and calls `reapplyPresets()` to re-read preset files and re-establish file watchers at the correct location. 4 files, +111/−0. Includes unit tests for path resolution with subdirectory `sourceDir`.

**Initial Assessment:**

- **Correctness:** 🟢 Correct. The `PresetsParser` already had a `sourceDir` setter but it was never called post-construction. The fix properly wires it up through a new controller method.
- **Regression risk:** ⚠️ Low. The fix only applies when source directory changes after initialization, which is a specific user flow.
- **Test hygiene / verification:** 🟢 Good. Unit tests included.
- **Documentation & traceability:** 🟢 Good. Clear before/after path examples.

**Original prompt:** CMake Prompt

**Updates:** Clean fix that leverages existing but unused API surface.

## ✅ Issue #4726 / PR #4729: [Bug] Kit scan ignoring cmake.enableAutomaticKitScan and N×scan race condition [Success]

**Reported behavior:** In large workspaces with many cmake projects, `scanForKitsIfNeeded()` never checked `enableAutomaticKitScan` and triggered unconditionally. Additionally, in single-root workspaces with N `cmake.sourceDirectory` entries, all projects shared `workspaceFolders[0]`, causing N redundant concurrent scans. Debug logs showed 80+ repetitions of `"Detected kits definition version change from undefined to 2"`.

**Agent patch (as implemented/claimed):** Copilot extracted the decision logic into a pure function `determineScanForKitsAction()` that takes version, config, concurrency, and test-mode flags and returns one of: 'scan', 'skip-and-update-version', 'blocked-by-concurrent', 'no-action'. A synchronous module-level guard prevents concurrent scans. 10 regression tests cover: config disabled + version mismatch → skip, concurrent guard → blocked, guard priority over config, version current → no-action, and test mode behavior. 3 files, +153/−4.

**Initial Assessment:**

- **Correctness:** 🟢 Correct. Pure function extraction for testability is excellent engineering. Both bugs are addressed: config check prevents unwanted scans, concurrency guard prevents races.
- **Regression risk:** ⚠️ Low. The extracted function preserves the existing scan-when-needed behavior while adding the missing checks.
- **Test hygiene / verification:** 🟢 Excellent. 10 regression tests with clear naming covering all decision paths.
- **Documentation & traceability:** 🟢 Good. Detailed PR description with function signature and test case summary.

**Original prompt:** CMake Prompt

**Updates:** High quality fix. The pure function extraction pattern is the gold standard for making complex decision logic testable.
