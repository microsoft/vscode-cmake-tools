/**
 * Processes coverage information files and updates the provided test run with coverage data.
 *
 * @param run - The test run to update with coverage data.
 * @param coverageInfoFiles - An array of file paths to coverage information files.
 * @param coverageData - A WeakMap to store the coverage data, mapping `vscode.FileCoverage` to an array of `vscode.FileCoverageDetail`.
 *
 * This function reads each coverage information file, parses its contents, and extracts coverage data for lines, branches, and functions.
 * It then creates `vscode.FileCoverage` objects and populates them with the extracted data, including branch coverage and function declarations.
 * The coverage data is stored in the provided `coverageData` WeakMap and added to the test run.
 *
 * If a coverage information file cannot be opened, a warning is logged and the file is skipped.
