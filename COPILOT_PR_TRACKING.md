## Detailed Tracking Table

| # | Start Date | End Date | Issue / PR | Model | Outcome | Takeaways |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1/23 | 1/27 | #4555 / PR #4659 | Sonnet 4.5 | Success | Copilot was able to break down the users' issue properly and received positive feedback from senior engineer reviewing. Success case — Copilot excels when the issue is well-defined and aligns with straightforward implementation patterns. |
| 2 | 1/23 | 2/9 | #4651 / PR #4660 | Opus 4.5 | Success | Fix addresses a real gating bug for additionalKits — include `additionalKits` in `availableKits` regardless of `showSystemKits`. Originally "Potential" — now merged. PR hygiene (linkage, boilerplate) remains a weak point even when technical approach is sound. Defensive, low-risk fixes are a strength. |
| 3 | 1/23 | | #4639 / PR #4661 | Opus 4.5 | Potential Success | Copilot properly included tests and the approach is sound as it is defensive and low-risk — sanitize null chars from env vars. PR hygiene (linkage, boilerplate) remains a weak point even when technical approach is sound. |
| 4 | 1/23 | | #4623 / PR #4678 | | Potential Failure | Copilot properly updated changelog and tied bug correctly – the test aligned with what the bug was reporting. However, the person that filed the issue also had a PR of their own, and Copilot approached it very differently. Additionally, I was given feedback that the contributor's PR was already fairly complete as they utilized an existing pattern in the rest of the codebase. What Copilot should have done is follow suit and frankly make the same PR as that is the more correct fix. Critical finding: Copilot does not reference or learn from existing PRs or established codebase patterns. When a contributor has already proposed a fix using existing patterns, Copilot should ideally recognize and align with that approach rather than diverging. This suggests Copilot lacks awareness of concurrent community contributions and existing code conventions. |
| 5 | 1/23 | 2/9 | #4589 / PR #4663 | Sonnet 4.5 | Failure | Directionally reasonable regex approach, but failed CI due to Windows path/URI normalization expectations; indicates insufficient end-to-end validation. |
| 6 | 1/23 | 2/9 | #4267 / PR #4665 | GPT-5.2-Codex | Failure | Suggested a solution in the PR description, but did not opt to implement during the session. |
| 7 | 1/27 | 2/4 | #4668 / PR #4669 | Sonnet 4.5 | Failure | Iterated on problem and at first Copilot came up with a band-aid fix. I opted to prompt it again and iterate to take its own feedback from the Copilot chat as well as senior engineers from the codebase; However, Copilot started making more mistakes as it continued to iterate. There were 4 requests for this fix, as there was a strong effort to fix it given that it has a lot of community activity to fix it. Tests ultimately were red by fourth iteration. Copilot struggles with iterative refinement — additional context and feedback led to regression rather than improvement. The "band-aid fix" pattern suggests Copilot prioritizes quick solutions over root cause analysis. Multi-iteration workflows may compound errors rather than resolve them. |
| 8 | 1/29 | | #4621 / PR #4674 | Sonnet 4.5 | Potential | Properly linked bug and during session, Copilot did conduct a review of its approach and iterated. All tests are red though. Self-review and iteration within a single session can produce positive outcomes. This suggests Copilot benefits from "thinking time" built into the workflow. |
| 9 | 1/29 | 2/3 | #4551 / PR #4672 | Sonnet 4.5 | Success | Copilot was able to properly generate a unit test for this fix, I tweaked prompt to what you can see below and simplified the request for creating unit tests. Simplified, focused prompts yield better results. Copilot performs better when given clear, scoped tasks (e.g., "generate unit test") rather than open-ended problem-solving. Prompt engineering significantly impacts output quality. |
| 10 | 1/29 | | #4509 / PR #4671 | Sonnet 4.5 | Potential Failure | Copilot was able to break down the users' issue properly, but it did not seem to give a complete approach nor provided unit tests. Copilot's review of its own fix was not very confident. Copilot can diagnose issues but falls short on implementation completeness. Lack of unit tests indicates gaps in understanding testing requirements for this codebase. Self-review confidence levels may be a useful signal for when human intervention is needed earlier. |
| 11 | 1/29 | 2/12 | #4613 / PR #4673 | | Failure (Closed) | Copilot attempted to fix deprecated command highlighting for variable names in CMake syntax by anchoring the regex pattern to line start. The change was small (+3/−2, 2 files) but was closed without merge. The underlying issue was addressed more comprehensively as part of the broader colorization rewrite (PR #4697). **Why closed:** Approach was too narrow — the fix addressed the symptom but not the broader grammar registration issues that PR #4697 solved holistically. |
| 12 | 1/30 | 2/9 | #4484 / PR #4681 | Opus 4.5 | Success | Copilot correctly identified the root cause: presets weren't exporting CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS by default (unlike kits), which caused compile_commands.json to be missing. The fix is minimal and mirrors existing kit behavior. Changelog entry was properly added. However, there were no unit tests created, but did create an entry for the changelog. |
| 13 | 1/30 | 2/4 | #4676 / PR #4677 | | Failure (Closed) | Copilot attempted to restore CMakeLists grammar registration for syntax highlighting by adding the correctly cased `CMakeLists.txt` to the filenames array. Changes requested by reviewer — the fix was too narrow and didn't address the full colorization regression from 1.22.26. **Why closed:** hanniavalera authored PR #4697 with a comprehensive revert+reapply approach that addressed the broader grammar migration issue. Copilot's fix only addressed one symptom. |
| 14 | 1/30 | | #4563 / PR #4679 | Sonnet 4.5 | Potential Success | Copilot gave positive feedback for fix, as it will address one common failure path – but did not create a changelog entry nor unit test. Partial solutions may be acceptable for incremental progress, but Copilot does not proactively identify missing deliverables (changelog, tests). Human checklist enforcement is still required. |
| 15 | 1/30 | | #4560 / PR #4680 | | Potential | Copilot attempted to normalize Visual Studio kit target architectures so `${buildKitTargetArch}` expands correctly instead of returning "unknown". The approach maps VS kit arch names to canonical target triples. Draft with +43/−5 across 4 files. Needs manual testing on Windows with various VS kits. Has 1 review comment. |
| 16 | 1/30 | | #4313 / PR #4682 | | Potential (Stalled) | [WIP] draft to fix missing environment variables in ctest command when using test presets. The PR has a checklist but only 1 commit. The issue is about test presets with environment variables not being passed to `ctest` invocation. Needs more implementation work. |
| 17 | 2/2 | 2/12 | #4683 / PR #4684 | | Failure (Closed) | Copilot proposed adding `onView:cmake.bookmarks` to activation events to fix the "No view is registered" error. Small fix (+4/−1, 2 files) but closed without merge. **Why closed:** The bookmarks feature was being reworked and the activation event approach was not the right fix. The broader activation logic needed different handling. |
| 18 | 2/2 | | #4667 / PR #4686 | | Potential (Stalled) | [WIP] draft to add auto-detection for `.cmake.in` files as cmake files. Copilot opened the PR with a placeholder description but only committed 1 commit. The feature request is straightforward (register file extension) but implementation is incomplete. |
| 19 | 2/3 | | #4000 / PR #4696 | Opus 4.6 | Potential Success | Copilot correctly identified that the CMake Cache Editor used a regular WebviewPanel that doesn't integrate with VS Code's native save system (Ctrl+S). The fix replaces it with a CustomTextEditorProvider, which ties into VS Code's document save lifecycle. This is a significant architectural change (552 additions across 6 files, including a new cmakeCacheEditorProvider.ts), registering a custom editor for CMakeCache.txt. The approach is sound and uses the correct VS Code API pattern. Changelog was included. However, this is a large surface-area change with no unit tests, and manual testing is critical to verify save/dirty-state/auto-save behaviors. PR is mergeable but blocked on reviews. Maintainer likelihood: Medium-High – approach is correct but the scope of the change warrants careful manual testing before merge. |
| 20 | 2/9 | 2/12 | #4219 / PR #4708 | Opus 4.6 | Success | Copilot identified a key mismatch in target resolution: with single-config generators (e.g., Ninja) and presets that don't set CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE, currentBuildType defaults to "Debug" but the codemodel stores targets under "" (empty string). The fix adds a fallback: when exact lookup fails and _target_map.size === 1, use the single available entry. Multi-config generators are unaffected. Applied to both cmakeFileApiDriver.ts and cmakeServerDriver.ts. 4 files, +113/−2, including unit tests. Changelog included. Maintainer likelihood: High – this is one of the strongest fixes in this batch. Clean root cause analysis, targeted fix that doesn't affect multi-config, unit tests included, and it addresses a frequently reported issue. |
| 21 | 2/9 | | #4051 / PR #4707 | Opus 4.6 | Potential | Copilot identified the root cause: VS 2017 (majorVersion 15) with its bundled CMake 3.12 doesn't support the host=x86 toolset field, but the extension was only excluding versions < 15 (i.e., VS 2013 and earlier). The fix would change the threshold from majorVersion < 15 to majorVersion < 16. However, this PR is [WIP] and in draft with 0 file changes committed (+0/−0). The root cause analysis is correct and the planned fix is minimal, but no code has shipped yet. Maintainer likelihood: Medium – the diagnosis is correct and the fix is trivial, but implementation is incomplete. Needs Copilot to finish committing the code. |
| 22 | 2/9 | 2/13 | #4358 / PR #4706 | Opus 4.6 | Success | Copilot identified that cmake.installPrefix was silently ignored when using presets because: (1) _refreshExpansions() only expanded it in the non-preset branch, and (2) generateConfigArgsFromPreset() never emitted -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX. The fix moves installPrefix expansion out of the non-preset guard and adds it to preset config arg generation with proper precedence (preset cacheVars > configureArgs > setting). 3 files, +15/−6. Follows the exact same pattern as CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS handling. Changelog included. Maintainer likelihood: High – mirrors an established pattern for another cache variable in the same function, minimal risk. |
| 23 | 2/9 | 2/11 | #4529 / PR #4705 | Opus 4.6 | Closed (Superseded) | Copilot correctly diagnosed that when a CMake task is defined in a .code-workspace file, VS Code sets task.scope to TaskScope.Workspace (a number), not a WorkspaceFolder object. The previous code blindly cast it, causing TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'path'). The fix extracts a shared getWorkspaceFolderFromTask() helper with proper type checking and graceful fallback. Small change: 2 files, +18/−6. The root cause analysis matches the stack trace in the issue perfectly. **Why closed:** The underlying fix was already merged via PR #4659 which addressed the same task.scope type-checking issue from a different angle. This PR was redundant. |
| 24 | 2/9 | 2/11 | #4512 / PR #4704 | Sonnet 4.5 | Closed (Stalled) | The PR is marked [WIP] and is still in draft with 0 file changes (+0/−0). The PR description is a placeholder ("Thanks for assigning this issue to me. I'm starting to work on it…"). Copilot has not yet produced any code for this multi-root workspace build task bug. The issue is about CMake tasks always building in the workspace root instead of the active folder. This appears to be a case where Copilot got stuck during investigation and never produced a fix. |
| 25 | 2/9 | | #3575 / PR #4702 | Opus 4.6 | Potential Success | Copilot correctly identified that terminal.sendText() silently truncates commands at ~4096 characters (terminal emulator buffer limit), causing CMake: Compile Active File to fail on complex projects with many -I flags. The fix writes long commands (>4000 chars) to a temporary script file (.sh on Unix, .cmd on Windows) and executes that instead. Copilot noted this reuses an established pattern from visualStudio.ts and kit.ts in the same codebase. Very small, targeted change: 2 files, +37/−1. Changelog included. No unit tests, but the fix is platform-aware and follows existing conventions. Maintainer likelihood: High – minimal, low-risk change that follows existing codebase patterns. The temp-file approach is already proven elsewhere in the repo. |
| 26 | 2/9 | | #4574 / PR #4701 | Opus 4.6 | Potential Success | Copilot correctly diagnosed that ${cmake.testProgram} and related variables were never registered as VS Code commands, so they only worked via internal Test Explorer debugging and failed from the Run and Debug panel. The fix registers three new VS Code commands (cmake.testProgram, cmake.testWorkingDirectory, cmake.testArgs) and adds a pickTestName() quick-pick fallback when invoked without test context. The PR also updates docs and maintains backward compatibility with the old ${cmake.testProgram} form. Changelog entry included. 5 files changed (+70/−13). This is a well-scoped, backward-compatible fix. No unit tests were added. Maintainer likelihood: Medium-High – the approach mirrors how other command-based variable substitutions work in VS Code extensions; needs manual testing to confirm quick-pick UX and backward compat. |
| 27 | 2/10 | 2/12 | #4569 / PR #4712 | | Success | After Quick Start generates CMakePresets.json, the extension now properly switches to preset mode. Copilot added one `onUseCMakePresetsChanged` event subscription in `ProjectController.setupProjectSubscriptions()` following the identical pattern already used for other preset-changed events. One-line fix, clean and minimal. 2 files, +6/−1. |
| 28 | 2/10 | 2/12 | #3578 / PR #4713 | | Success | `$penv{}` in CMakePresets v7+ `include` paths only resolved variables from `process.env`. Variables from `cmake.environment` / `cmake.configureEnvironment` were silently ignored. Copilot added `settingsEnvironment` setter to `PresetsParser` and merged settings env into `penvOverride` for `expandString()`. Well-scoped fix with integration test. 4 files, +110/−2. |
| 29 | 2/12 | 2/13 | #4453 / PR #4719 | | Success | CPack execution commands were gated on `useCMakePresets` in their `when` clauses, but the status bar button had no such gate — so clicking the button worked while the command palette showed nothing. Copilot removed the `useCMakePresets` gate from CPack execution commands and fixed `getCPackCommandEnvironment()` to properly merge kit/config/variant environment in non-preset mode. 3 files, +12/−7. |
| 30 | 2/12 | 2/23 | #4520 / PR #4724 | | Success | Copilot fixed garbled characters (Mojibake) in Output panel for UTF-8 build output on non-UTF-8 Windows. When `outputLogEncoding` is `auto`, the extension now validates each output chunk as UTF-8 first before falling back to system code page. Extracted `isValidUtf8()` to `src/encodingUtils.ts`. Added `useAutoEncoding` flag to `ExecutionOptions`. Includes 20 unit tests covering ASCII, CJK UTF-8, GBK rejection, overlong sequences, surrogates, boundary splits, and invalid bytes. 5 files, +206/−5. Strong fix with comprehensive testing. |
| 31 | 2/13 | 2/18 | #4727 / PR #4728 | | Success | CMakePresets.json discovery failed after selecting CMakeLists.txt in a subdirectory of a workspace. Copilot added `PresetsController.updateSourceDir()` to propagate source directory changes to the `PresetsParser` and reload presets from the new location. Includes unit tests for path resolution with subdirectory `sourceDir`. 4 files, +111/−0. |
| 32 | 2/13 | 2/18 | #4726 / PR #4729 | | Success | Kit scan ignored `cmake.enableAutomaticKitScan: false` and had N×scan race condition in multi-project workspaces. Copilot extracted decision logic into pure `determineScanForKitsAction()` function with synchronous module-level guard. 10 regression tests added. 3 files, +153/−4. High quality — pure function extraction for testability is excellent engineering. |
