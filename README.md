## Setup and Installation
Ensure CMake is available on your system. A couple of options are:
- [Download CMake](https://cmake.org/download/).
- Utilize the CMake that is bundled with a Visual Studio installation.

Install the CMake Tools extension from the Extensions pane within VS Code or from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools).

Ensure that either you've added your CMake executable to your PATH, or you've adjusted the `cmake.cmakePath` setting to point to your CMake executable. 

## Resources
- [Docs](docs/README.md) for comprehensive documentation.
- [Quick Start](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/CMake-linux) to get up and running fast, by allowing you to generate startup files and presets.
