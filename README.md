## Issues? Questions? Feature requests?

**PLEASE**, if you experience any problems, have any questions, or have an idea
for a new feature, create an issue on [the GitHub page](https://github.com/vector-of-bool/vscode-cmake-tools)!

This extension itself *does not* provide language support for the CMake
scripting language. For that I recommend [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=twxs.cmake).
