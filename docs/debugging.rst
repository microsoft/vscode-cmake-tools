Target Debugging and Launching
##############################

CMake Tools removes some of the friction required in setting up debugging.
Because C and C++ projects may define multiple (sometimes dozens or even
hundreds) of executables, creating a ``launch.json`` may be difficult, tedious,
and error-prone.

If you define any executable targets via CMake, CMake Tools will be aware of
them and allow you to start a debugger on them.

.. note::
    Debugging is only supported when using *CMake Server* mode. This mode will
    be enabled automatically on CMake versions at least as new as 3.7.2, but is
    completely unavailable on older CMake versions.

    Target debugging used to be supported on prior versions, but was difficult
    and error-prone, creating more problems than it solved. If you are running
    an older CMake version and wish to use target debugging, you'll have to
    update your CMake version.

By default, the launch or debug of an executable target will cause it to be
built.

.. note::
    The build on launch can be disabled with a setting, see
    :ref:`conf-cmake.buildBeforeRun`.

Selecting a Launch Target
*************************

The "launch target" or "debug target" is initially unset. The first time you try
to run target debugging, CMake Tools will ask you to specify a target, which
will be persisted between sessions.

The active launch target is shown in the status bar to the right of the *Debug*
button:

.. image:: res/launch_target.png
    :align: center

Pressing this button will show the launch target selector and lets one change
the active launch target.

Quick Debugging
***************

Quick-debugging lets you start a debugger on a target without ever creating
a ``launch.json``.

.. note::
    At the moment, only the debugger from Microsoft's ``vscode-cpptools``
    extension is supported with quick-debugging. See :ref:`debugging.launch-json`
    below for using ``launch.json`` and other debuggers.

Quick debugging can be started using the *CMake: Debug Target* command from
the command pallette, or by pressing the associated hotkey (the default is
:kbd:`Ctrl+F5`).

.. note::
    Quick-debugging does not let you specify program arguments or other
    debugging options. See :ref:`debugging.launch-json` for more options.

.. _debugging.launch-json:

Debugging with CMake Tools and ``launch.json``
**********************************************

Sometimes, more flexibility is needed for debugging, including setting things
like the working directory or command line arguments. In addition, one may want
to use a debugger other than the one included with Microsoft's
``vscode-cpptools``.

All these things can be done using ``launch.json``. The primary obstacle to
using ``launch.json`` is that the path to the executable binary might be
difficult to know in advance. CMake Tools can help by using
*Command substitution* in ``launch.json``. This is already used by things like
the process selection when attaching to a running process. It works by simply
specifying a a command-based substitution in the appropriate field of
``launch.json``.

Here is a minimal example of a ``launch.json`` that uses the
``cmake.launchTargetPath`` and ``cmake.launchTargetDirectory`` to start a debugger
on the active selected launch target:

.. code:: javascript

    {
        "version": "0.2.0",
        "configurations": [
            {
                "name": "(gdb) Launch",
                "type": "cppdbg",
                "request": "launch",
                // Resolved by CMake Tools:
                "program": "${command:cmake.launchTargetPath}",
                "args": [],
                "stopAtEntry": false,
                "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
                "environment": [
                    {
                        // add the directory where our target was built to the PATHs
                        // it gets resolved by CMake Tools:
                        "name": "PATH",
                        "value": "$PATH:${command:cmake.launchTargetDirectory}"
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "OTHER_VALUE",
                        "value": "Something something"
                    }
                ],
                "externalConsole": true,
                "MIMode": "gdb",
                "setupCommands": [
                    {
                        "description": "Enable pretty-printing for gdb",
                        "text": "-enable-pretty-printing",
                        "ignoreFailures": true
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }

The value of the ``program`` attribute is resolved by CMake Tools to the
absolute path to the program to run.

.. note::
    A successful :ref:`configure <configuring>` must be executed before
    ``cmake.launchTargetPath`` and ``cmake.launchTargetDirectory`` will resolve correctly.

Running Targets Without a Debugger
**********************************

Sometimes one will want to just run a target and see its output. This can
be done with the *CMake: Execute the current target without a debugger* command,
or the associated keybinding (the default is :kbd:`Shift+F5`).

The output of the target will be shown in an integrated terminal.
