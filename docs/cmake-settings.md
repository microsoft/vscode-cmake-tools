# Configure CMake Tools settings

CMake Tools supports a variety of settings that can be set at the user, or workspace, level via VSCode's `settings.json` file. This topic  covers the available options and how they are used.

Options that support substitution, in the table below, allow variable references to appear in their strings. See [variable substitution](#variable-substitution), below, for more information about variable expansion.

## CMake settings

|Setting  |Description | Default value | Supports substitution |
|---------|---------|---------|-----|
| `cmake.autoSelectActiveFolder`| If 'false', your active folder only changes if you manually run the `CMake: Select Active Folder` command. | 'true' | no |
| `cmake.buildArgs` | An array of additional arguments to pass to `cmake --build`. | `[]` (empty array-no additional arguments) | yes |
| `cmake.buildBeforeRun` | If `true`, build the launch/debug target before running the target. | `true` | no |
| `cmake.buildDirectory` | Specify the build directory (i.e. the root directory where `CMakeCache.txt` will be generated.) | `${workspaceFolder}/build` | yes |
| `cmake.buildEnvironment`| An object containing `key:value` pairs of environment variables, which will be passed only to the compiler. | `null` (no environment variables specified) | yes | 
| `cmake.buildToolArgs` | An array of additional arguments to pass to the underlying build tool. | `[]` (empty array-no additional arguments) | yes |
|  `cmake.cacheInit` | Path, or list of paths, to cache-initialization files. Passed to CMake via the `-C` command-line argument. | `[]` (empty array-no cache initializer files) | no |
| `cmake.cmakePath`| Specify location of the cmake executable. | `cmake` (causes CMake Tools to search the `PATH` environment variable, as well as some hard-coded locations.) | Supports substitution for `workspaceRoot`, `workspaceFolder`, `workspaceRootFolderName`, `userHome`, `${command:...}` and `${env:...}`. Other substitutions result in an empty string. |
| `cmake.cmakeCommunicationMode` | Specifies the protocol for communicating between the extension and CMake | `automatic` | no |
| `cmake.configureArgs` | Arguments to CMake that will be passed during the configure process. Prefer to use `cmake.configureSettings` or [CMake variants](variants.md).</br> Do not pass `-D` arguments using this setting. | `[]` (empty array-no arguments) | yes |
| `cmake.configureEnvironment` | An object containing `key:value` pairs of environment variables, which will be passed to CMake only when configuring.| `null` (no environment variable pairs) | yes |
| `cmake.configureSettings` | An object containing `key:value` pairs, which will be passed to CMake when configuring. The same as passing `-DVAR_NAME=ON` via `cmake.configureArgs`. | `null` (no values) | yes |
| `cmake.copyCompileCommands`| If not `null`, copies the `compile_commands.json` file generated by CMake to the path specified by this setting whenever CMake successfully configures. |  `null` (do not copy the file) | yes |
| `cmake.defaultVariants` | Override the default set of variants that will be supplied when no variants file is present. See [CMake variants](variants.md). | | no |
| `cmake.environment` | An object containing `key:value` pairs of environment variables, which will be passed onto CMake when configuring and to the compiler. | `null` (no environment variables) | yes |
| `cmake.generator` | Set to a string to override CMake Tools preferred generator logic. If set, CMake will unconditionally use it as the `-G` CMake generator command line argument. ||no|
| `cmake.installPrefix` | If specified, sets a value for `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` when running CMake configure. If not set, no value will be passed.</br>If `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` is set via `cmake.configureArgs` or `cmake.configureSettings`, `cmake.installPrefix` will be ignored.| `null` (no value specified) | yes |
| `cmake.loggingLevel` | A string setting that specifies how much output CMake Tools produces in its output channel. Set to one of `"trace"`, `"debug"`, `"info"`, `"note"`, `"warning"`, `"error"`, or `"fatal"`. `"trace"` is the most verbose.</br></br>Regardless of the logging level, CMake Tools writes all levels of logging to the CMake Tools log file. This file is useful if you need to [troubleshoot CMake Tools](troubleshoot.md) | `"info"` | no |
| `cmake.mingwSearchDirs`| List of paths to search for a MinGW installation. This means that GCC does not need to be on your `$PATH` for it to be found via kit scanning. | ["C:\\MinGW"] (Search in C:\MinGW for a MinGW installation) | no |
| `cmake.parallelJobs` | Specify  the number of jobs run in parallel during the build. | | no |
| `cmake.preferredGenerators` | A list of strings of generator names to try, in order, when configuring a CMake project for the first time. | | no |
| `cmake.saveBeforeBuild` | If `true` (the default), saves open text documents when build or configure is invoked before running CMake. | `true` | no |
| `cmake.sourceDirectory` | Directory where the root `CMakeLists.txt` is stored. | `${workspaceFolder}` | yes |

## Variable substitution

Some options support the replacement of special values in their string value by using a `${variable}` syntax. The following built-in variables are expanded:

| Variable  | Expansion  |
|---------|---------|
|`${workspaceRoot}`|**DEPRECATED**. The full path to the workspace root directory.|
|`${workspaceFolder}` | The full path to the workspace root directory. |
|`${workspaceRootFolderName}`| The name of the leaf directory in the workspace directory path.|
|`${buildType}`|The current CMake build type. For example: `Debug`, `Release`, `MinSizeRel`|
|`${buildKit}`| The current CMake kit name. For example: `GCC 7.3.0`|
|`${generator}`| The name of the CMake generator. For example: `Ninja`|
|`${projectName}`|**DEPRECATED**. Expands to the constant string `"ProjectName"` CMake does not consider there to be just one project name to use. The concept of a single project does not work in CMake. Use `${workspaceRootFolderName}`, instead.|
|`${userHome}`|  The full path to the current user's home directory. |

### Environment variables

Environment variables are expanded using the `${env:VARNAME}` and `${env.VARNAME}` syntax, where `VARNAME` is the environment to variable to expand. If the named environment variable is undefined, the expansion is an empty string.

### Variant substitution

Variant options are expanded using the `${variant:VARIANTNAME}` syntax, where the name of the currently active choice of the provided `VARIANTNAME` variant option is expanded. If the variant option is undefined, the expansion is an empty string.

### Command substitution

CMake Tools can expand VS Code commands. for example, you can expand the path to the launch target by using the syntax `${command:cmake.launchTargetPath}`

Be careful with long-running commands because it isn't specified when, or how many times, CMake Tools will execute a command for a given expansion.
