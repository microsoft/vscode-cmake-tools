# Configure CMake Tools settings

CMake Tools supports a variety of settings that can be set at the user, or workspace, level via VSCode's `settings.json` file. This topic  covers the available options and how they are used.

Options that support substitution, in the table below, allow variable references to appear in their strings. See [variable substitution](#variable-substitution), below, for more information about variable expansion.

## CMake settings

| Setting  | Description | Default value | Supports substitution |
|---------|---------|---------|-----|
| `cmake.additionalCompilerSearchDirs`| List of paths to search for additional compilers, like a MinGW installation. This means that GCC does not need to be on your `$PATH` for it to be found via kit scanning. For example: `["C:\\MinGW\\bin"]` (Search in C:\MinGW\bin for a MinGW installation) | `[]` | no |
| `cmake.additionalKits` | Array of paths to custom kit files. These are in addition to the default kit files. | `[]` | no |

| `cmake.allowUnsupportedPresetsVersions` | Enables the use of presets files that are using features from the versions that Cmake Tools extension doesn't currently support. Unknown properties and macros will be ignored. | `false` | no |

## Variable substitution

Some settings support the replacement of special values in their string value by using a `${variable}` syntax. The following built-in variables are expanded:

| Variable | Expansion |
|---------|---------|
|`${workspaceRoot}`|**DEPRECATED**. The full path to the workspace root directory.|
|`${workspaceFolder}` | The full path to the workspace root directory. |
|`${sourceDirectory}` | The full path to the root CMakeLists.txt. (not substituted for `cmake.sourceDirectory`, `cmake.cmakePath`, `cmake.ctestPath`, or in Kits) |
|`${workspaceRootFolderName}`| The name of the leaf directory in the workspace directory path.|
|`${buildType}`|The current CMake build type. For example: `Debug`, `Release`, `MinSizeRel`, `RelWithDebInfo`|
|`${buildKit}`| The current CMake kit full name. For example: `GCC 7.3.0`|
|`${buildKitVendor}`| The current CMake kit vendor name. Possible values: `GCC`, `MSVC`, `Clang` and so on|
|`${buildKitTriple}`| The current CMake kit target triple. For example: `arm-none-eabi`|
|`${buildKitVersion}`| The current CMake kit version. For example: `9.3.0`|
|`${buildKitHostOs}`| The current CMake kit host OS. Possible values: `win32`, `osx`, `linux` and so on, all in lowercase|
|`${buildKitTargetOs}`| The current CMake kit target OS. Possible values: `win32`, `osx`, `linux` and so on, all in lowercase|
|`${buildKitTargetArch}`| The current CMake kit target architecture. Possible values: `x86`, `x64`, `arm`, `aarch64` and so on, all in lowercase|
|`${buildKitVersionMajor}`| The current CMake kit major version. For example: `7`|
|`${buildKitVersionMinor}`| The current CMake kit minor version. For example: `3`|
|`${generator}`| The name of the CMake generator. For example: `Ninja`|
|`${projectName}`|**DEPRECATED**. Expands to the constant string `"ProjectName"` CMake does not consider there to be just one project name to use. The concept of a single project does not work in CMake. Use `${workspaceRootFolderName}`, instead.|
|`${userHome}`|  The full path to the current user's home directory. |

### Environment variables

Environment variables are expanded using the `${env:VARNAME}` and `${env.VARNAME}` syntax, where `VARNAME` is the environment to variable to expand. If the named environment variable is undefined, the expansion is an empty string.

### Variant substitution

Variant options are expanded using the `${variant:VARIANTNAME}` syntax, where the name of the currently active choice of the provided `VARIANTNAME` variant option is expanded. If the variant option is undefined, the expansion is an empty string.

### Command substitution

CMake Tools can expand VS Code commands. For example, you can expand the path to the launch target by using the syntax `${command:cmake.launchTargetPath}`

Be careful with long-running commands because it isn't specified when, or how many times, CMake Tools will execute a command for a given expansion.

Supported commands for substitution:

|command|substitution|
|-------|------------|
|`cmake.getLaunchTargetPath`|The full path to the target executable, including the filename. The existence of the target is not validated.|
|`cmake.getLaunchTargetDirectory`|The full path to the target executable's directory. The existence of the directory is not validated.|
|`cmake.getLaunchTargetFilename`|The name of the target executable file without any path information. The existence of the target is not validated.|
|`cmake.getLaunchTargetName`|The name to the target. The existence of the target is not validated.|
|`cmake.launchTargetPath`|The full path to the target executable, including the filename. If `cmake.buildBeforeRun` is true, invoking this substitution will also start a build.|
