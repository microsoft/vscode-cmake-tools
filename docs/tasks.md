# Configure with CMake Tools tasks
You can create a configure task from the VS Code command pallette by running the **Tasks: Configure task** command.

By selecting "CMake: configure" template, if you are not using presets, this task will be generated in tasks.json file: 


```json
    {
        "type": "cmake",
        "label": "CMake: configure",
        "command": "configure",
        "targets": [
            "all"
        ],
        "problemMatcher": [],
        "detail": "CMake template configure task"
    }
```

Note: When running this task, the configure settings (including configure options and configure environment) defined in settings.json will be used.

However, if you are using presets, this task will be generated in tasks.json file:

```json
    {
        "type": "cmake",
        "label": "CMake: configure",
        "command": "configure",
        "preset": "${command:cmake.activeConfigurePresetName}",
        "detail": "CMake template configure task"
    }
```
You can modify "preset" option with your chosen configure preset name.
Note: When running this task, the configure settings defined in CMakeUserPresets.json/CMakePresets.json will be used.


# Build with CMake Tools tasks
Similarly, You can create a build task from the VS Code command pallette by running the **Tasks: Configure task** command.

By selecting "CMake: build" template, if you are not using presets, this task will be generated in tasks.json file: 

```json
    {
        "type": "cmake",
        "label": "CMake: build",
        "command": "build",
        "targets": [
            "all"
        ],
        "group": "build",
        "problemMatcher": [],
        "detail": "CMake template build task"
    }
```
Note: When running this task, the build settings (including buildArgs and build environment) defined in settings.json will be used.

However, if you are using presets, this task will be generated in tasks.json file:

```json
    {
        "type": "cmake",
        "label": "CMake: build",
        "command": "build",
        "preset": "${command:cmake.activeBuildPresetName}",
        "detail": "CMake template build task"
    }
```

Note: When running this task, the configure settings defined in CMakeUserPresets.json/CMakePresets.json will be used.

You can chain a configure task to your build task by adding this to your task's definition:

```json
        "dependsOn": [
            "CMake: configure"
        ]
```

# Install with CMake Tools tasks
Similarly, You can create an install task from the VS Code command pallette by running the **Tasks: Configure task** command.

By selecting "CMake: install" template, this task will be generated in tasks.json file:

```json
    {
        "type": "cmake",
        "label": "CMake: install",
        "command": "install",
        "problemMatcher": [],
        "detail": "CMake template install task"
    }
```

# Test with CMake Tools tasks
Similarly, You can create a test task from the VS Code command pallette by running the **Tasks: Configure task** command.

By selecting "CMake: test" template, if you are not using presets, this task will be generated in tasks.json file: 

```json
    {
        "type": "cmake",
        "label": "CMake: test",
        "command": "test",
        "detail": "CMake template test task"
    }
```
Note: When running this task, the test settings defined in settings.json will be used.

However, if you are using presets, this task will be generated in tasks.json file:

```json
    {
        "type": "cmake",
        "label": "CMake: test",
        "command": "test",
        "preset": "${command:cmake.activeTestPresetName}",
        "detail": "CMake template test task"
    }
```

Note: When running this task, the test settings defined in CMakeUserPresets.json/CMakePresets.json will be used.

# Clean/Clean-rebuild with CMake Tools tasks
Similarly, you can create a Clean/Clean-rebuild task from the VS Code command pallette by running the **Tasks: Configure task** command.

By selecting "CMake: clean" or "CMake: clean rebuild" template, these task will be generated in tasks.json file:

```json
    {
        "type": "cmake",
        "label": "CMake: clean",
        "command": "clean",
        "detail": "CMake template clean task"
    },
    {
        "type": "cmake",
        "label": "CMake: clean rebuild",
        "command": "cleanRebuild",
        "detail": "CMake template clean rebuild task"
    }
```
