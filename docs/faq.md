## How do I learn about CMake?

CMake Tools is not the same as CMake. There are many great resources around to learn how to use CMake.

- Jason Turner's [C++ Weekly - Intro to CMake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPMvU64RUTY) is a good introduction.
- [CMake's documentation](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/)
- [CMake's "Mastering CMake" book](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/book/mastering-cmake/)
- ["Professional CMake"](https://crascit.com/professional-cmake/)- a $30 book by Craig Scott (one of the maintainers of CMake).
