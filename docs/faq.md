## How can I get help?

Please visit [the end-user support chat](https://gitter.im/vscode-cmake-tools/support). This is a community chat. Microsoft does not actively monitor it.

Also look in the [Troubleshooting guide](troubleshoot.md).

Check the [CMake Tools issue tracker](https://github.com/vector-of-bool/vscode-cmake-tools/issues) and [What's New](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cmake-tools/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) to see if your issue is already known/solved before submitting a question or bug report. Feel free to [Open a Github issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cmake-tools/issues) if your problem hasn't been reported.

## What about CMake language support?

CMake Tools was created separately from the [CMake extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=twxs.cmake), which provides language coloring and autocompletion support.

## How do I learn about CMake?

CMake Tools is not the same as CMake. There are many great resources around to learn how to use CMake.

- Jason Turner's [C++ Weekly - Intro to CMake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPMvU64RUTY) is a good introduction.
- [CMake's documentation](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/)
- [CMake's "Mastering CMake" book](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/book/mastering-cmake/)
- ["Professional CMake"](https://crascit.com/professional-cmake/)- a $30 book by Craig Scott (one of the maintainers of CMake).

## How does CMake Tools work with C and C++ IntelliSense?
