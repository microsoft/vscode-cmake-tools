## What about CMake language support?

CMake Tools was created separately from the [CMake extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=twxs.cmake), which provides language coloring and autocompletion support.

## How do I learn about CMake?

CMake Tools is not the same as CMake. There are many great resources around to learn how to use CMake. See Jason Turner's [C++ Weekly - Intro to CMake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPMvU64RUTY) for a good video introduction.

[CMake's documentation](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=twxs.cmake) is also available.
