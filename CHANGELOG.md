## 1.2.1
Thank you to the following CMake Tools contributors: koemai, bjosa, emanspeaks, som1lse,
dcourtois, tsing80, andy-held, notskm, thezogoth, yokuyuki, dbird137, fabianogk, randshot.

**vector-of-bool** has moved on to other things and Microsoft is now maintaining this extension. Thank you **vector-of-bool**
for all of your hard work getting this extension to where it is today!

Breaking changes:
- The publisher id changes to ms-vscode.cmake-tools. This requires that you uninstall earlier versions of the extension.
- Scanning for kits is able to detect more accurately multiple VS installations.
  To achieve this, a Visual Studio kit is defined differently now in cmake-tools-kits.json:
  the "visualStudio" field represents an ID unique to the installation
  as opposed to "VisualStudio.${VS Version}" (which may be the same for multiple same year VS installations).
  The CMake Tools Extension is still able to work with the old definition VS kits,
  but for simplicity and to avoid duplicates in the json file it will prompt for permission to delete them
  each time a "Scan for kits" is performed.

Features:
- Support for localized messages.
- Cross compile support for CppTools integration.
- Adapt CppTools integration to API version 3. [#637](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-cmake-tools/issues/637)
- Expand kit environment variables. [#460](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-cmake-tools/issues/460)
- Add new commands: launchTargetDirectory, buildType, buildDirectory. [#334](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-cmake-tools/issues/334), [#654](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-cmake-tools/issues/654), [#564](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-cmake-tools/issues/564), [#559](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-cmake-tools/issues/559), [#695](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-cmake-tools/issues/695)
- Add support for VS2010.

Improvements:
- Restructuring of the CMake Driver.
- Improve stability of CMake Generator Selection. [#512](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-cmake-tools/issues/512)
- Refactor and extend CMS-server driver test.
- Rework the CMake Build from a terminal to a task.
- Add Launch target test.
- Increase wait time in test to open terminal.

Bug fixes:
- Cannot execute current target without a debugger. [#601](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-cmake-tools/issues/601)
- Path clobbering by bad kit file env. [#701](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-cmake-tools/issues/701), [#713](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-cmake-tools/issues/713)
- Target install missing. [#504](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-cmake-tools/issues/504)
- CTest controller updated on reconfig. [#212](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-cmake-tools/issues/212)
- Recalculate total for every run of CTest.
- Debug target does not find GDB. [#375](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-cmake-tools/issues/375)

## 1.1.3

Many thanks to [Yonggang Luo](https://github.com/lygstate) for several changes
in this version.

Removal:

- The visual CMake cache editor GUI is gone. The API with which it was drawn is
  being removed from a future version of VS Code, and the feature had many
  issues. A future CMake GUI will be introduced with more features and greater
  stability.

Features and Tweaks:

- On Linux, will detect old CMake versions and offer to do an automatic
  upgrade. Windows support is pending. If you have a macOS devices and would
  like to contribute, please open a pull request!
- Smarter parsing of GCC and Clang compile errors to fold `note:` and
  `required from:` blocks into their main diagnostic. This permits the
  folding and browsing of template and macro instantiation errors in a nicer
  fashion. MSVC error parsing pending. (**NOTE**: There is an upstream issue
  with the sort order of diagnostic information, so `required from`
  tracebacks may appear out-of-order).

Fixes:

- On Windows, "Launch target in terminal" will use `cmd.exe` unconditionally.
  This works around issues with command quoting in PowerShell
- "Debug target" will prefer `lldb-mi` to `lldb`. Fixes issues where `cpptools`
  is unable to launch the debugger.
- Document the `environmentVariables` field on kits.
- Fix legacy CMake mode not setting the CMake generator.
- Permit limited variable expansion for `cmake.cmakePath` in `settings.json`
  (refer to documentation for more details).

## 1.1.2

A bugfix release for [these issues](https://github.com/vector-of-bool/vscode-cmake-tools/milestone/13?closed=1).

## 1.1.1

A bugfix release for [these issues](https://github.com/vector-of-bool/vscode-cmake-tools/milestone/12?closed=1).

**BREAKING CHANGE**: Variant substitutions follow a new `${variant:var-key}`
syntax to match the special namespacing of substitutions.

## 1.1.0

1.1.0 includes a few new major features:

- `cpptools` integration for IntelliSense
- A Project Outline view as a custom explorer
- Building individual source files from the editor menus
- New UI for progress and cancellation

See the changelog in the official documentation for more information.
